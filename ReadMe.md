# Overview 

This project is to showcase how I designed and implemented the Leeds Beer Quest challenge and go into the technical aspects around the demo app. This includes how to run the project locally or if preferred how you can toggle the backend API to use an alternative backend repository. Firstly, we will touch upon the design approach and why a simplified structure was decided before going into details on the Backend API implementation and then finally how to run the application. 

## Web Design / UI

I've kept the UI wireframe simple, mimicking how google maps shows their reviews but also added all the extra relevant information to the side. This would be the display once youâ€™ve clicked into the specific pub.

Initially a clickable list view would be displayed ordered by distance to the post code entered.

# Backend API Design

# Running the application 

TODO 

You can run the backend API by using the .Net CLI. First build the solution and then run the application.

`dotnet build`
`dotnet run`
